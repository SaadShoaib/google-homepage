I spent 2 days on completing this project. At first I thought it was going to be impossible. So I went to discord and asked for help there. They advised me to revise the previous lectures, so I did.

And that opened my eyes to everything I have missed. I googled a lot during the process, and learned about flexbox, margin, paddings and all the important basic concepts.

I can feel my understanding about the subject have improved and I'm ready to take on furhter projects.
